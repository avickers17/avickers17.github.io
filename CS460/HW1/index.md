##Homework 1
Our first assignment was to learn git, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap.  Then to make a repository and website that houses all our information including a dummy website showing our basic knowledge of these programs. All programs that I had never really used before.  This was a shock to the system at first, but I worked hard the first week putting in 14 hour days and got what I needed to be successfl. If I don't have the knowledge, I find it, learn it, and move forward!
