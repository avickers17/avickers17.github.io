## Homework 1
Our first assignment was to learn Git, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap.  Then to make a repository and website that houses all our information including a dummy website showing our basic knowledge of these programs. All programs that I had never really used before.  This was a shock to the system at first, but I worked hard the first week putting in 14 hour days and got what I needed to be successful.  I am the kind of person

### Git
Downloaded Git from my bash shell.  I went to many pages online and learned all about how to use it and how to issue commands.  Then to solify my knowledge, we broke it down more in class as to how git is working behind the scenes to update your repository.  The main functions that I used git for were:

```
git clone repository /*to get a respository sent to me, namely mine*/
git pull /*to pull information from my repository at git to my local*/
git add file1 file2 ... /*to stage my files locally*/
git commit file1 file2 -m "Helful message" /*to commit my staged files and include a messag*/)
git push /*to push my local resposity data to update my git repository*/
git status /*to find out what status my local respository is at before making commits or additions*/
```

Made many pushes to confirm changes were being made and seeing the updates that I was making to my site and respository.

###HTML, CCS, and BootStrap
Had to watch over 2 hour long videos for each program as these were newer languages that I hadn't had a chance to use as of yet. However I was familiar with HTML and CSS simply by looking over website scripting.  I watched the videos and made cheat sheets to help me learn what was needed to complete my objective.  I used notepad++ for the coding and a python extention to help with autofilling HTML code.  Once I had the hang of it, I started creating my pages for my site.  I used some basic BootStrap classes (mostly the container class for formatting) and made some of my own so that I could format as needed.  An example of this was my navbar which needed some help from BootStrap to make it look nicer:

```
	<nav class="navbar navbar-default>
		<div class="container">
			<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
				<li class="home"><a href="index.html">Homepage</a></li>
				<li><a href="lists.html">Popular Board Games</a></li>
				<li><a href="columns.html">Places to Buy</a></li>
				<li><a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</nav>
```

In this example I created a nav item with a specific BootStrap class that helped to create my formatting.  I seperating this formatting by using a div, and placed the content into a list.  With the coding completed, I was able to link my pages together.

###Github Pages
Probably the hardest thing for me to fully comprehend was the Github pages.  There wasn't a lot in the assignement description that really talked about how to set up your pages.  But I reversed engineered the examples that were provided and I was able to figure out how to pick a theme, create the code/data for the theme, update my title, make multiple pages, and link them all together.  Again having 1 week to learn all of these programs and to figure out how to put this together was one of the most challenging tasks I have had to date, but once completed I felt like my knowledge has improved greatly as a CS major!  I feel that overall my project turned out really nice considering the timeline that was set for me!  I look forward to learning more and doing more things to improve my site going forward!
