## Homework 1
Our first assignment was to learn Git, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap.  Then to make a repository and website that houses all our information including a dummy website showing our basic knowledge of these programs. All programs that I had never really used before.  This was a shock to the system at first, but I worked hard the first week putting in 14 hour days and got what I needed to be successful.  I am the kind of person

### Git
Downloaded Git from my bash shell.  I went to many pages online and learned all about how to use it and how to issue commands.  Then to solify my knowledge, we broke it down more in class as to how git is working behind the scenes to update your repository.  The main functions that I used git for were:

```
git clone repository (to get a respository sent to me, namely mine)
git pull (to pull information from my repository at git to my local)
git add file1 file2 ... (to stage my files locally)
git commit file1 file2 -m "Helful message" (to commit my staged files and include a message)
git push (to push my local resposity data to update my git repository)
git status (to find out what status my local respository is at before making commits or additions)
```
